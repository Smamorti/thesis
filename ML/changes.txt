1) in modelTraining, try to fix the error with keras.layers
2) in plotting, change name for genetic xgboost (fixes non-existant directory error)
   !! for nn, have to change back!
3) in configuration.activation, the activation class. Also here we have to fix the layers.ReLU error
4) in plotting: also save .png along with .pdf
5) Added selu activation function 
6) in the input file for NNs: fixed some typos in hyperparameters section
7) in plotting: now the plotting script is able to plot booleans (as 0 and 1) and strings on the x-axis as well
